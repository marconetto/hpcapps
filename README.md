# HPC Applications


The goal of this repo is to document the setup and execution of a few High
Performance Computing (HPC) applications. What is not the goal is to provide
a fine grained optimization of the application execution for a particular
target platform.

So for each application we will have info on:

- overview of the app; what the app does, the problem it solves, etc.
- basic setup
- basic execution
- references to documents that talk about the application


## Applications


1. [Chapter1:](chapter1/) Matrix Multiplication - Hello World ;-)
1. [Chapter2:](chapter2/) Weather Research & Forecasting Model (WRF)
1. [Chapter3:](chapter3/) GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulations (GROMACS)
1. [Chapter4:](chapter4/) Open Field Operation and Manipulation (OpenFOAM)
